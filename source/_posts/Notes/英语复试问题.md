Hello，Professors! I'm very glad to be here for interview.I'm GuoShuai from Gansu Province.Last year I Graduated from Nankai University， my major is Informatiom Security and Law.

During my bachelor period，I'm very interested in many major courses especially practical ones，like Vulnerability Exploitation, Penetration Test Fundamentals and Malware Analysis，from where I learned many useful practical skills to detect and analyse computer viruses.

I am an optimistic person,likeing to try new things.During my bachelor period，I'm interested in Cyber security,AI and Cryptgraphy.And in my daily life,I Like cooking,making friends with different people,traveling around the country.In my spare time,I read books.Books can really give me a chance to experience different life.It feels good.
I also have some cons. For example, three minutes of heat, I will be affected by the environment,and that's why I really want to attend your group,a place full of academic atmosphere.
In the process of preparing for the re-examination, I also did an internship mainly about using machine learing methods to assure cloud hosting security.
Thank you for your time.
